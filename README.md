# TurboVAD

**TurboVAD** is a **lightweight, high-speed** Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system that utilizes **self-attention** and **spectral features** for accurate voice detection. Designed for real-time applications, TurboVAD achieves **high efficiency and accuracy**, making it ideal for **low-latency** environments.

## üöÄ Features
- **Self-Attention Mechanism** for efficient feature weighting.
- **Spectral Feature Analysis** including spectral centroid, entropy, flatness, and harmonic noise ratio.
- **Optimized C Implementation** for performance and efficiency.
- **Model Size < 1KB**, making it ideal for memory-constrained applications.
- **Fine-tuned for Bird Activity Detection** to enhance avian vocalization analysis.

## üìå Technical Overview
TurboVAD processes **8 spectral features** extracted from audio signals:
1. Spectral Centroid
2. Spectral Entropy
3. Spectral Flatness
4. Harmonic Noise Ratio
5. Spectral Centroid SD
6. Spectral Entropy SD
7. Spectral Flatness SD
8. Harmonic Noise Ratio SD

These features represent **mean (Œº) and standard deviation (œÉ)** over a time frame, providing robust temporal characteristics for accurate classification.

These features are processed using a **self-attention mechanism**, which assigns dynamic importance to each feature and refines classification using a softmax-based scoring system. The model is **specifically optimized for bird activity detection**, making it ideal for wildlife monitoring and ornithological research.

## ‚ö° Model Architecture
- **Feature Extraction:** Precomputed spectral statistics.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Weights important features using learned attention matrices.
- **Classification:** A lightweight decision function with a sigmoid activation to determine voice presence.
